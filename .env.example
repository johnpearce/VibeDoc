# VibeDoc Agent Application Environment Variables
# Agent application environment variable configuration file

# =========================
# 🔑 REQUIRED CONFIGURATIONS
# =========================

# Silicon Flow API Key for AI model access (Required)
# Get it from: https://siliconflow.cn
# Purpose: Core service for AI development plan generation
SILICONFLOW_API_KEY=your_siliconflow_api_key_here

# Application port
PORT=7860

# Runtime environment
ENVIRONMENT=production

# =========================
# 🔌 OPTIONAL MCP SERVICE CONFIGURATIONS
# =========================

# 💡 Note: As an Agent application, VibeDoc can call multiple MCP services to enhance functionality
# These configurations are all optional - the system will gracefully degrade if not configured

# DeepWiki MCP Service (DeepWiki content parsing service)
# Used to parse deepwiki.org links, providing in-depth technical documentation
# DEEPWIKI_MCP_URL=https://your-mcp-service-url/deepwiki

# Fetch MCP Service (General web scraping service)
# Used to parse general web links (GitHub, blogs, documentation, etc.)
# FETCH_MCP_URL=https://your-mcp-service-url/fetch

# 📋 AGENT APPLICATION NOTES
# =========================

# 🤖 Agent vs MCP Difference:
# • Agent Application: Calls multiple MCP services, provides complete business solution
# • MCP Service: Called by Agent, provides specific functional components
# • VibeDoc is an Agent application, demonstrating intelligent routing and service collaboration

# 🚀 Quick deployment to ModelScope:
# 1. Add environment variables in space settings
# 2. Required: SILICONFLOW_API_KEY, PORT, NODE_ENV
# 3. Optional: MCP service configurations (enhanced features)
# 4. SDK selection: Gradio
# 5. Startup file: app.py

# 🔧 Feature Highlights:
# • Intelligent MCP service routing
# • Multi-source knowledge fusion
# • Fault-tolerant degradation mechanism
# • Complete development plan generation
# • AI coding prompt output

# ⚠️ Security Reminders:
# • Don't commit real API keys to Git
# • Use environment variables in production
# • Regularly rotate API keys
